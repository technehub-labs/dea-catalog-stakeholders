# Contributing to `dea-catalog-stakeholders`

Minimal. The cardinal rules govern the only contribution shape that matters
for this repository.

## Authorship

Every authorship-bearing field in this repository must carry
`Emmanuel A. Otchere` (or, for org-level CFF entries, `TechNeHub Labs`).
The string `Coder`, `Agent`, `Hermes`, `Claude`, `GPT`, `Cline`, `OpenAI`,
`MiniMax`, `MiniMax-M3`, or any other agent/tool name is forbidden in
any authorship-bearing field of any published artifact.

This rule is enforced by `scripts/check_authorship.py` (AUT-001..003,
blocking; runs `--strict` in `validate-authorship.yml`). It is data-driven
from `reconciliation/authorship-fields.yaml` and parses both CR metadata
shapes (bold-line and table). The full rule statement lives in
`docs/governance/cardinal-rules.md`.

If your contribution introduces a new authorship-bearing field, extend
the registry in the same PR; the gate will block the change otherwise.

## How to land work

1. Open a `feature/...`, `fix/...`, or `refactor/...` branch.
2. Develop, test, commit.
3. Open a PR; CI runs this repo's workflows: `validate` (schema), `catalog-conformance` (regenerator, index gate, CST suite, ID system, tests), `validate-allocation` (OpenDEAM pin), `validate-authorship`, `validate-entity-system`. Address any failures before requesting review.
4. Squash-merge on approval; the branch is auto-deleted.
